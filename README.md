## Snapshots of documentation

The current development work and git history of documentation is in the `dafny-lang/dafny` repository, in the `docs`
folder.

This `dafny-lang/dafny.github.io` repo is the target for `https://dafny.org` and is the entry point to all the user-facing
documentation about Dafny.
What is here are _snapshots_ of the Dafny documentation (the docs folder mentioned above) at the time of each release
(beginning wwith 3.9.0). Each snapshot is in its own folder, e.g. dafny.org/vX.Y.Z, with `latest` 
containing the most recent.

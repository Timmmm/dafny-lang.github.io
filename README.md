## Snapshots of documentation

The current development work and git history of documentation is in the `dafny-lang/dafny` repository, in the `docs`
folder.

This `dafny-lang/dafny.github.io` repo is the target for `https://dafny.org` and is the entry point to all the user-facing
documentation about Dafny. What is here is a _snapshot of the documentation at the time of the latest release_.
There are also links (at `https://dafny.org/snapshots`) to all of the past snapshots since this process began (with v3.9.0).
Each old snapshot is in its own folder, named vX.Y.Z corresponding to its version.
